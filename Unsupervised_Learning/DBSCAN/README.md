# DBSCAN Clustering Implementation

## a. Brief Description of the Algorithms Implemented

This project implements the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are close to each other based on a distance metric (epsilon) and a minimum number of points required to form a dense region (min_samples). Unlike algorithms such as k-means, DBSCAN does not assume any prior knowledge of the number of clusters and can identify outliers as noise. It is particularly effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shape and handling noisy data.

## b. Summary of the Dataset(s) Used for Each Algorithm

In this implementation, the **Iris dataset** from the Seaborn library is used, which contains measurements of different attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three species of Iris flowers: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. For this clustering task, only the petal length and petal width are used to demonstrate how DBSCAN can identify clusters within the data without prior knowledge of the species labels.

## c. Instructions for Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository or download the necessary files.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn sklearn`.
3. Run the provided code in a Jupyter notebook or Python environment.
4. Experiment with different values of `epsilon` (eps) and `min_samples` parameters to observe how the clustering results change.
5. Visualize the clustering results using the provided plots.
