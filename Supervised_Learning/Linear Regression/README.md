# Linear Regression with Custom SingleNeuron Class

This repository contains an implementation of **Linear Regression** using a custom `SingleNeuron` class, designed to predict one variable (bill depth) based on another (bill length) for **Adelie penguins**. The model is trained using a single artificial neuron with a linear activation function, and it is optimized using **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**. The project includes data visualization, model training, and analysis of model performance, including the effect of learning rate on training accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Linear Regression Implementation**: Using a simple neural network.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preprocessing data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Error analysis and learning rate tuning.
- **Visualization**: Plots of regression data, training error, and learned model.

## Dataset

This implementation uses the **Palmer Penguins** dataset, focusing specifically on the **Adelie species**. The dataset contains information about penguins, including various physical measurements. For this example, we use two parameters from the dataset:

- **Bill length (mm)**
- **Bill depth (mm)**

The dataset is preprocessed to only include data for the Adelie species, and rows with missing values are removed. The cleaned data is then used for training the linear regression model.

### Data Description:

- **Feature**: `bill_length_mm` (length of the penguin's bill in millimeters)
- **Target**: `bill_depth_mm` (depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters)

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`palmer_penguins.csv`), which you may need to upload or place in the correct directory when using the code on your local machine or platforms like Google Colab.

## Instructions for Reproducing Results

### 1. Install Dependencies

If you don't have the required libraries, install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2. Load the Penguins Dataset

Download or upload the `palmer_penguins.csv` file into your environment. You can load the dataset and visualize it with:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("palmer_penguins.csv")
df = df.iloc[:151][["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"]]
sns.set_theme()
plt.scatter(df.bill_length_mm, df.bill_depth_mm)
plt.xlabel("Bill Length (mm)")
plt.ylabel("Bill Depth (mm)")
plt.title("Adelie Penguin Bill Data")
plt.show()
```

### 3. Define and Train the Model

Use the `SingleNeuron` class to train the model:

```python
node = SingleNeuron(linear_activation)
node.train(X, y, alpha=0.0001, epochs=10)
```

### 4. Visualize the Model

Plot the regression line after training:

```python
domain = np.linspace(np.min(X) - .5, np.max(X) + .5, 100)
plt.plot(domain, node.predict(domain.reshape(-1, 1)))
plt.scatter(X, y, color="lightseagreen")
plt.title("Penguin Bill Data with Linear Regression Line")
plt.show()
```

### 5. Analyze Training Error

Visualize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) during training:

```python
plt.plot(range(1, len(node.errors_) + 1), node.errors_)
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Mean Squared Error")
plt.title("MSE during Training")
plt.show()
```

## Summary of Results

- The linear regression model successfully predicts the bill depth of Adelie penguins based on their bill length, with a **positive correlation** between the two variables.
- The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** decreases over time during training, indicating the model's convergence.
- The **learning rate** has an impact on the model's training. A higher learning rate may lead to less accurate results, and itâ€™s important to choose an optimal value for the model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple linear regression model using a custom neural network class in Python. The model can be further extended to handle more complex datasets and relationships, and future work may include experimenting with regularization techniques and different learning algorithms for improved performance.

### Key formatting improvements:
- The title and section headers are bolded and properly structured.
- Code blocks are formatted using triple backticks (```), and each code snippet has a consistent language identifier (e.g., `bash`, `python`).
- Lists are organized with bullet points for clarity.
- Instructions are broken down into steps for easier reading.
- The entire README follows a clean structure that is common in GitHub repositories, making it easy to follow.
