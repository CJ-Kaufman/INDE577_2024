# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Implementation for Penguin Species Classification

## Overview

This code implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classifying penguin species based on their physical features, specifically bill length and bill depth. KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions by finding the majority class among the 'k' closest training points to a given test point. The code demonstrates how the KNN algorithm works for multi-class classification using the **penguins dataset** from the `seaborn` library.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**:
   - The Euclidean distance function calculates the straight-line distance between two points in the feature space, used to measure similarity between data points.
   
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Given a test point, the KNN algorithm computes the distances to all points in the training set and selects the 'k' closest neighbors. It assigns the most frequent class among those neighbors to the test point.

3. **KNN Classification Prediction**:
   - This function predicts the class label for a test point by considering the labels of its 'k' nearest neighbors and selecting the majority class.

4. **Classification Error**:
   - The classification error function computes the fraction of incorrect classifications in the test set by comparing predicted and true labels.

5. **Choosing the Best K**:
   - The optimal 'k' value is determined by testing different values and plotting the classification error for each. The best 'k' balances bias and variance to minimize classification errors.

## Dataset

The dataset used is **seaborn's 'penguins' dataset**, which contains measurements of different physical characteristics of three penguin species: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**. Specifically, we use the following features:

- **bill_length_mm**: Length of the penguin's bill (in mm)
- **bill_depth_mm**: Depth of the penguin's bill (in mm)

The dataset is split into a training set (67%) and a testing set (33%) to evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm.

## Instructions for Reproducing the Results

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open in Google Colab**:
   - You can open the code directly in Google Colab by clicking [Open in Colab](#).

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - The code uses the `seaborn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` libraries. Install them if necessary:
     ```bash
     pip install seaborn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
     ```

4. **Run the Code**:
   - Simply run the code in your Colab notebook or Jupyter environment. The output includes visualizations of the data, classification performance, and error plots for different 'k' values.

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the results, including the classification error and the optimal value for 'k'.
