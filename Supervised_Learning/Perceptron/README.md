Note to self: Looks like, using this established framework, I can upload code from google colab and reorganize it appropriately. Therefore, 
first get functional code in google colab, 
then make it pretty, 
then upload here to github for final project

As of 12/7/2024, functional codes are: 
5/12

Pretty codes are: 
0/12
