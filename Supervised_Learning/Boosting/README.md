# Ensemble Boosting Implementation

## a. Brief Description of the Algorithms Implemented

This project demonstrates the application of **Boosting** algorithms, specifically **AdaBoost** and **Gradient Boosting**, to enhance the performance of machine learning models. Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners (models slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong model. The main idea is to train models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors made by the previous one. Key algorithms implemented include:

- **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):** Trains a series of classifiers where each subsequent model corrects errors made by the previous one. We use decision trees as base learners and focus on misclassified instances to improve model performance.
  
- **Gradient Boosting:** Similar to AdaBoost, but instead of focusing on misclassifications, it fits each new model to the residual errors of the previous model. This results in more accurate models as each step improves on the previous one.

## b. Summary of the Datasets Used for Each Algorithm

### Dataset: Penguins (from Seaborn)
- **Features:** Bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass (for classification tasks).
- **Target Variable:** Species (Adelie and Chinstrap) for classification tasks. The dataset is pre-processed to focus only on two species, and missing values are removed.
- **Purpose:** The dataset is used to train AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting models to classify penguin species based on physical measurements.

### Artificial Cubic Data (for Gradient Boosting)
- **Features:** A single input feature generated from a linearly spaced range of values from -0.9 to 0.9.
- **Target Variable:** The cubic transformation of the feature with some added noise (y = X^3 + noise).
- **Purpose:** This dataset is used to demonstrate the power of Gradient Boosting for regression tasks, where a model is trained to predict the cubic function of the input.

## c. Instructions for Reproducing Your Results

To replicate the results in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Open the notebook in Google Colab:**
   - [Open in Colab](#)
2. **Install necessary libraries:**
   Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
   ```python
   !pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
   ```
3. **Load and preprocess the data:**
   - The **Penguins** dataset is loaded using Seaborn's `sns.load_dataset()`.
   - Missing values are dropped, and only two species (Adelie and Chinstrap) are considered for classification.
4. **Train the models:**
   - AdaBoostClassifier and GradientBoostingRegressor are used for classification and regression tasks respectively.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to visualize decision boundaries and model predictions.
