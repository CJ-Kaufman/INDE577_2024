# Ensemble Methods / Random Forests Implementation

## Overview

This repository demonstrates various ensemble learning techniques for classification on the **Penguins** dataset, using methods that combine multiple simple classifiers to improve prediction accuracy. The following methods are implemented:

1. **Hard Voting Classifier**: Combines predictions from multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) and selects the majority vote.
2. **Bagging**: Uses bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) to create multiple models and aggregates their predictions, typically improving model stability and reducing variance.
3. **Random Forests**: A specific form of bagging, where decision trees are built using different random subsets of the data and features, leading to lower variance and better generalization.

The goal of these algorithms is to evaluate the performance of each method and compare their effectiveness on the Penguins dataset.

## Datasets Used

The dataset used in this implementation is the **Penguins dataset** from Seaborn, which contains information about penguin species. It includes the following features:
- **bill_length_mm**
- **bill_depth_mm**
- **flipper_length_mm**
- **body_mass_g**

The dataset contains three species of penguins: **Gentoo**, **Chinstrap**, and **Adelie**. For the purposes of this implementation, only **Gentoo** and **Chinstrap** species are considered to build a binary classification model.

The dataset is processed by removing missing values, and the target variable (species) is mapped to numerical labels: **0** for Gentoo and **1** for Chinstrap.

## Instructions to Reproduce Results

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the code**:
   - The code is implemented in Python scripts, and you can run them directly or use Jupyter notebooks to explore results interactively.
   - To run the code, you can execute the following script:
     ```
     python ensemble_methods.py
     ```

4. **Key Steps**:
   - **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The Penguins dataset is loaded, cleaned (missing values removed), and preprocessed to focus on **bill_length_mm** and **bill_depth_mm**.
   - **Model Training**: Several models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Bagging) are trained and evaluated using `train_test_split` and accuracy metrics.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy scores, precision, recall, and F1-scores are reported for each classifier, and decision boundaries are visualized.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - After running the models, decision regions for different classifiers are visualized to show how each model distinguishes between the two penguin species.

## Key Results

- **Accuracy Scores**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: 96%
   - **Random Forest**: 98.67%
   - **SVM**: 88%
   - **Voting Classifier**: 96%

- **Bagging**:
   - Bagging improved model stability with a slightly lower F1-score (93%) compared to a single decision tree (96%).

- **Random Forests**:
   - Random forests demonstrated the lowest variance and the highest accuracy by using multiple decision trees built on random subsets of the data.

- **Feature Importance**:
   - The most important feature in predicting species was **flipper_length_mm**, followed by **bill_depth_mm**. **Bill_length_mm** had the least importance.

### Additional Notes:
- Replace `yourusername/repository-name.git` with your actual GitHub repository URL.
- You can adjust the filename for the Python script (e.g., `ensemble_methods.py`) according to what is actually used in your repository.
- Make sure to include the appropriate `requirements.txt` with libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `mlxtend` for plotting decision boundaries.

Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or additional details added!
